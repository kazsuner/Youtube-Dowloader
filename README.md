<h1> ðŸ“º Youtube Dowloader </h1>

## ðŸ“ƒ Explanation 

Using **Python**, I created this app to download videos from Youtube. 

ðŸ”¸ How to use it?

Well, it's very simple. The only thing we have to do is paste the link of the video we want to download, once the video is downloaded, it will show us a message that the video has been downloaded successfully. Once all the above is done, we go to our download folder and there we will have the video.

## âš™ Installation

- **pip install tk**
- **pip install os-sys**
- **pip install Pillow**
- **pip install pytube**

âš  To avoid errors, we must change the direction of the images, depending on where you place them.

I leave the 3 lines of code here in case you have problems with this step:
